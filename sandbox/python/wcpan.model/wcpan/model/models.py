    """The Model is the main component of micromodels. Model makes it trivial
    to parse data from many sources, including JSON APIs.

    You will probably want to initialize this class using the class methods
    :meth:`from_dict` or :meth:`from_kwargs`. If you want to initialize an
    instance without any data, just call :class:`Model` with no parameters.

    :class:`Model` instances have a unique behavior when an attribute is set
    on them. This is needed to properly format data as the fields specify.
    The variable name is referred to as the key, and the value will be called
    the value. For example, in::

        instance = Model()
        instance.age = 18

    ``age`` is the key and ``18`` is the value.

    First, the model checks if it has a field with a name matching the key.

    If there is a matching field, then :meth:`to_python` is called on the field
    with the value.
        If :meth:`to_python` does not raise an exception, then the result of
        :meth:`to_python` is set on the instance, and the method is completed.
        Essentially, this means that the first thing setting an attribute tries
        to do is process the data as if it was a "primitive" data type.

        If :meth:`to_python` does raise an exception, this means that the data
        might already be an appropriate Python type. The :class:`Model` then
        attempts to *serialize* the data into a "primitive" type using the
        field's :meth:`to_serial` method.

            If this fails, a ``TypeError`` is raised.

            If it does not fail, the value is set on the instance, and the
            method is complete.

    If the instance doesn't have a field matching the key, then the key and
    value are just set on the instance like any other assignment in Python.
